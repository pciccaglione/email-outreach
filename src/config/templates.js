      `Hi {firstName},

I'm AJ, a mortgage broker based right here in Milford. My wife's from Trumbull, and we moved back from Hawaii last year after our daughter was born ‚Äî so I've been rebuilding my local realtor network across {city} and surrounding towns.

At Barrett Financial Group, I work with 100+ wholesale lenders to help buyers get creative financing and faster closings. Here's a quick example:

I recently funded a condo purchase at Walnut Beach in Milford ‚Äî a building that had been on Fannie Mae's "Do Not Lend" list for years. After working directly with the HOA and the lender's underwriters, I found a single-unit approval product that got my clients funded in just 10 days.

If you ever have a tricky deal like that, I'd love to help get it across the finish line. I can typically get pre-approval letters in under 2 hours once the application's complete.

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call next week to connect?

Best,

      `Hey {firstName},

Just wanted to follow up in case my first note got buried ‚Äî and share another quick story from right here in {city}.

A Milford realtor called last month ‚Äî her buyer had an investment property under contract but was short on funds for the down payment and closing costs. We met the next day and mapped out a first-lien HELOC on another property he owned free and clear. Within two weeks, we accessed $300k, allowing him to close on time and finish repairs to get renters in within a month.

That's the kind of creative, fast-moving lending I focus on ‚Äî solving problems other lenders can't, and helping realtors protect their deals.

Even if you don't have a file right now, I'd love to connect for a quick intro call and explore how we can make {companyName} buyers' offers stand out.

Does next week work for a short chat?

      `Hey {firstName},

Following up from my last email ‚Äî wanted to share another quick win from right here in {city}.

Last month, a local realtor reached out with a buyer who was short on funds for an investment property closing. We solved it fast by setting up a first-lien HELOC on another property the buyer owned free and clear.

Result: $300k accessed in two weeks, closed on time, and the buyer finished repairs to get renters in within a month.

This is what I do ‚Äî find creative solutions that protect your deals and help your buyers close faster.

Circling back in case you missed my first note. Here's another example of how I help {city} realtors close tough deals:

A Milford agent called with a buyer who needed funds fast for an investment property. The buyer had another property owned free and clear, so we structured a first-lien HELOC and accessed $300k within two weeks ‚Äî closing on time and getting renters in within a month.

That's the kind of problem-solving I bring to every deal.

Before I close the loop, I wanted to share one last story that shows how I work.

A few months ago I handled a $4M purchase in Fairfield County with a $1M down payment. By structuring the borrower's main income correctly, we avoided using rental income and cut out over 50 lender conditions. We got clear-to-close two weeks ahead of schedule ‚Äî giving the realtor and buyer total peace of mind while they simultaneously sold their existing home.

That's what I aim for on every file ‚Äî fast, transparent, local, and reliable.
